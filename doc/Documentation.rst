ESClient usage
==============

Start or install ElasticSearch
------------------------------
First of all, you have to get ElasticSearch running. If you don't have it
installed, please head over to the ElasticSearch_ site and download it.
Once unpacked, you can simply run ElasticSearch in the foreground with:

``bin/elasticsearch -f``

See.. it's easy to get a test system up and running.

.. _ElasticSearch: http://www.elasticsearch.org/

Installing ESClient
-------------------
Installing ESClient is easy too. You can use pip or easy_install, whichever
you prefer.

E.g. with easy_install you'd enter:

``sudo easy_install esclient``

Alternatively you may also download ESClient from its Github_ site. After
unpacking, you can install ESClient with:

``sudo python setup.py install``

.. _Github: https://github.com/eriky/ESClient

An interactive Python session
-----------------------------
To demonstrate ESClient, we will walk through an interactive Python session
and show the ESClient API by example.

First, fire up python:

``$ python``

At the prompt, enter:

``>>> import esclient``

You can read the documentation that comes with the esclient code by entering:

``>>> help(esclient)``

This should be basic stuff for the average Python programmer though. So let
us really dive into ESClient now.
You first need to create an ESClient object, like so:

``>>> es = esclient.ESClient()```

ESClient will by default use localhost as the hostname in combination with
the default port 9200. You can supply an alternative location for ElasticSearch
like so:

``>>> es = esclient.ESClient('http://<hostname>:<port>')``

Now that we have an ESClient instance, we can start doing some interesting
stuff. First of all let's request the status of the ElasticSearch cluster:

``>>>es.status()``

::

  {u'indices': {}, u'ok': True, u'_shards': {u'successful': 0, u'failed': 0, u'total': 0}}

Well, great. Now let's create an index. Open the create index API page at
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-create-index.html
and read that page. Now we are going to map this knowledge to ESClient.

First of all we need to create a request body that allows us the specify
the number of shards and number of replicas we want for our index::

  body= { 
    "settings" : {
      "index" : {
        "number_of_shards" : 1,
        "number_of_replicas" : 0
      }
	}
  }

With this, we can create an index easily:

``>>> es.create_index("contacts", body=body)``
